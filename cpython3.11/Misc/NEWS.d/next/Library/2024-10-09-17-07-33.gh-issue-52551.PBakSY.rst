Fix encoding issues in :func:`time.strftime`, the
:meth:`~datetime.datetime.strftime` method of the :mod:`datetime` classes
:class:`~datetime.datetime`, :class:`~datetime.date` and
:class:`~datetime.time` and formatting of these classes. Characters not
encodable in the current locale are now acceptable in the format string.
Surrogate pairs and sequence of surrogatescape-encoded bytes are no longer
recombinated. Embedded null character no longer terminates the format
string.
