# 04. SigmaOS System Design

This tutorial describes the SigmaOS kernel components, how they fit together,
and how `procs` interact with them. By the end of this tutorial, you should be
able to understand the full scheduling flow of a `proc`, from the moment it is
spawned until the moment it starts running. Additionally, you should understand
the main components of the realm namespace.
